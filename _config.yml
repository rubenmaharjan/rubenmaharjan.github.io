          I am currently engaged in an ongoing Natural Language Processing (NLP) project in collaboration with the International Storytelling Center. The project aims to digitize and transcribe a vast historical archive of over 50 years of performance recordings, making them more easily accessible and searchable for researchers, scholars, and other interested parties. Additionally, this project allows for the development of new research and analysis methods and aims to preserve the rich history of the performances for future generations.
